## üìù Individual Programs

### Age Program
- **File**: [age.c](./age.c)
- **Description**: A program that calculates the user's age based on their birth year.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int birth_year, current_year, age;
    printf("Enter birth year: ");
    scanf("%d", &birth_year);
    printf("Enter current year: ");
    scanf("%d", &current_year);
    age = current_year - birth_year;
    printf("Your age is: %d", age);
    return 0;
}
```

### Divisible by 9
- **File**: [divisible-by-9.c](./divisible-by-9.c)
- **Description**: This program checks if a given number is divisible by 9.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);
    if (number % 9 == 0)
        printf("%d is divisible by 9\n", number);
    else
        printf("%d is not divisible by 9\n", number);
    return 0;
}
```
